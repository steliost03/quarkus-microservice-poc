# quarkus-microservice-poc

## Overview

POC microservice (**user-ms**) implemented with Quarkus and some of its extensions.
This microservice receives HTTP requests and performs various MongoDB operations, with data representing hypothetical users in a system. <br>
This was used as the code demo for the 'Quarkus' section of the [DevStaff "Battle of Java Frameworks" event](https://www.meetup.com/devstaff/events/294641142) (13/07/2023).

Please note that a Maven version of **3.8.2** or higher is required in order to run Maven goals from the `quarkus-maven-plugin` (for example: `mvn quarkus:dev` which can be used to run the application in [development mode](https://quarkus.io/guides/getting-started#development-mode)).

The project also requires a container engine to be running in the background (e.g. Docker) in order for it to run locally in development mode. <br> 
It has been developed in Java 17.

This project is not meant to represent something that is (or should be) used in a production scenario, it is just a demonstration of the features of Quarkus and some of its most important extensions.

## Extensions & Libraries

* **RESTEasy Reactive** -> Î—andles the HTTP requests/responses, and the **automatic subscription** to the Uni/Multi transformations.
* **MapStruct** -> Handles transformations between model objects / entity objects / DTOs.
* **ReactiveMongoClient** -> A component provided by the Quarkus MongoDB extension for executing MongoDB operations in a reactive (asynchronous & non-blocking) way.
* **Panache (ReactivePanacheMongoRepository)** -> Panache is a Quarkus extension built upon Hibernate ORM. `ReactivePanacheMongoRepository` is a component of Panache, executing MongoDB CRUD operations in a reactive way with very little extra code needed by the developer. 
* **SmallRye OpenAPI** -> The default implementation Quarkus uses to generate OpenAPI specifications & Swagger UI pages.
* **SmallRye Mutiny** -> Quarkus and all of the above mentioned extensions use SmallRye Mutiny to express and implement all of their reactive APIs and operations.

## Test requests


**A collection with sample HTTP requests are available in the `docs/requests` directory, in 
`json` and `har` formats [here](doc/requests).** They have been tested with Postman and Insomnia.

With the preset configuration properties for local execution (found in `main/resources/application.properties`), you can see the OpenAPI and SwaggerUI pages for this application respectively from the following links (app must be running locally):

`http://localhost:8080/openapi?format=json` <br>
`http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/`
